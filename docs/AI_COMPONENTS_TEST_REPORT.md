   ```
   Get key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

2. **Test Manual AI Triage**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/ai-triage/trigger \
     -H "X-Dev-Bypass: true" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```

3. **Access Admin Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/admin/settings
   - Click "AI Rules" tab to manage rules
   - Click "AI Triage" tab to configure settings

### Testing Recommendations
1. Create test pain points with various keywords
2. Trigger manual AI triage
3. Monitor AI rule activations
4. Check email notifications for AI insights
5. Review triage logs for performance
