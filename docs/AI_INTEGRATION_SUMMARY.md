## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Database Tables
- `ai_rules`: 4 active rules configured
- `ai_triage_config`: Weekly automated processing enabled
- `ai_triage_logs`: Ready for execution logs
- `ai_rule_logs`: Tracks rule activations
- `pain_points`: Source data for AI processing

### API Endpoints (All Functional)
- `GET /api/admin/ai-triage/status` - Check triage status
- `GET/POST /api/admin/ai-triage/settings` - Configure AI triage
- `POST /api/admin/ai-triage/trigger` - Manual trigger
- `GET/POST /api/admin/ai-rules` - Manage AI rules
- `POST /api/cron/ai-triage` - Scheduled execution

### Email Integration
AI-enhanced notifications include:
- Pain point summaries
- Sentiment indicators
- AI confidence scores
- Suggested actions
- Category assignments

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Access Admin Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/admin/settings
   - Review AI Rules tab
   - Configure AI Triage settings

2. **Test End-to-End Flow**
   - Submit a safety-related pain point
   - Watch AI categorize and route it
   - Check email for AI-enhanced notification

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - Review AI triage logs
   - Check rule activation history
   - Analyze processing times

### Production Readiness
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API integrated
- ‚úÖ Error handling implemented
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting considered
- ‚úÖ Logging configured
- ‚úÖ Database schema deployed
