## Phase 1



## Review, Escalation & Feedback Loop

**Review, Escalation & Feedback Loop**

- **Triage Team Review - AI**\
    Submissions are automatically routed to the appropriate division leaders or subject matter experts for initial review.

- **Escalation to Leadership (EXCOM)**\
    High-impact or cross-departmental ideas are elevated to EXCOM for consideration, especially those tied to revenue, margin, safety, or efficiency.

- **Submitter Feedback & Visibility**

    - Submitters are notified when their idea is:

        - Received

        - Under review

        - Selected for implementation or EXCOM discussion

    - Ideas can be tracked on the public-facing dashboard with status tags (e.g., "In Review", "In Progress", "Implemented")

- **Recognition**

    - Highlighted ideas are shared in Town Halls, newsletters, or division updates

    - Optional: badges, “Idea of the Month”, or small incentives
