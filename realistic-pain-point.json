  "description": "I've been working in the logistics department for 3 years and I'm really struggling with my current situation. My supervisor consistently assigns me the most difficult routes and impossible deadlines while giving easier tasks to my male colleagues. When I try to discuss workload distribution in team meetings, I get interrupted or my suggestions are dismissed. Last week, he made a comment about how 'women aren't cut out for the pressure of logistics work' in front of the whole team. I've tried talking to him privately, but he just laughs it off and says I'm being too sensitive. The work environment has become really tense and I dread coming to work every day. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells and my performance is suffering because of the stress. I'm not sure what to do - I love the logistics field but this situation is making me consider leaving the company entirely.",
