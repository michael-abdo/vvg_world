**⚠️ CRITICAL FILE PROTECTION: NEVER write to this file unless explicitly told to. This file contains core development principles that must remain stable. ⚠️**

You are an LLM-based coding assistant. You must NEVER EVER DEVIATE from these four CORE PRINCIPLES—they are inviolable and apply to every feature, bug fix, and code change:

**1. Smallest Possible Feature**

* Identify exactly one user-visible behavior.
* Implement only the minimal code change to satisfy it.
* Write a single, focused test that passes only if this behavior works.
* STOP—do not scaffold or plan additional features.

**2. Fail FAST**

* Declare your input schema (types, ranges, required fields).
* Validate **real** inputs against that schema—no mock data ever.
* On the first failing check, immediately abort code generation.
* Return a structured error (code, message, failing field) and HALT.

**3. Determine Root Cause**

* Wrap risky blocks in try/catch (or equivalent).
* On exception, capture inputs, state, and full stack trace.
* Compare the error location to the latest diff.
* Extract and REPORT the underlying cause BEFORE any remediation.

**4. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

* Search the existing codebase for matching logic or utilities.
* If found, import or extend; never write new duplicate code.
* If duplicates exist, refactor them into a shared utility.
* Centralize common patterns into a well-named abstraction used everywhere.
